## Interactive Storytelling

 Megan Majocha is a deaf PhD student who faces significant challenges in communicating her research due to the lack of advanced scientific vocabulary in American Sign Language (ASL). Her story inspired the creation of the website, which explores the topic of inclusive design. The digital world often remains inaccessible to people with disabilities. The project aims to bring awareness to Megan's journey in developing new signs to present her research while providing accessibility features, allowing users to customize the website based on their needs.
